Short Bio
======
I am an associate professor working at the [School of Engineering Science](https://www.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/), [Osaka University](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en), Japan.  I am running a lab together with [Professor Kensuke Harada](http://www.hlab.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/people/harada/) and [Assistant Professor Keisuke Koyama](https://kk-hs-sa.website/). The website of our lab is https://www.roboticmanipulation.org. The name of the website shows our research topic -- robotic manipulation. Prior to Osaka University, I was on a tenure-track position at the Manipulation Research Group, [Intelligent System Research Institute](https://unit.aist.go.jp/is/index.html), [National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html) during 2015-2017. I was affiliated with the [Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/) from 2013 to 2015 and did my postdoc research at the [Manipulation Lab](http://mlab.ri.cmu.edu/) in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I got my PhD in Robotics from the [Graduate School of Information Science and Technology](https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.shtml), [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) in 2013.

Research Interest and Past Studies
======
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">My major interest is smart manufacturing using dual-arm robots: Developing and deploying grasping planning, motion planning, and other low level and high level task planning algorithms for next-generation factories. I am also studying visual perception, force control, and learning approaches to make up the inherent shortages of planning algorithms. Back to my postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University, I was working with [Professor Matt Mason](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mason/) and focused on regrasp. During my Ph.D. at the University of Tokyo, I was working with [Professor Rui Fukui](https://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/person/rui_fukui/rui_fukui.htm), [Professor Tomomasa Sato](https://researchmap.jp/read0007519), and [Professor Yasuo Kuniyoshi](http://www.isi.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/member/) and focused on grasping, caging, and the related mechanical design problems. Prior to my PhD study, I worked on motion planning under the supervision of Professor Hong Liu at Peking University.</div>

Prospective Students
======
If you are considering our lab, you are probably looking at the top-tier institutes working on robotic manipulation. Thank you very much for your interest. In our lab, we challenge our students to develop practical hardware and software systems. We have strong connections with industry and train our students to not only publish high-quality paper but also develop systems that solve real-world problems raised by our partners. The research topics of students working with me could be found [in this page](http://wanweiwei07.github.io).
