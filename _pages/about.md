Short Bio
======
I am a Ph.D. student in robotic manipulation at the [School of Engineering Science](https://www.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}, [Osaka University](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en){:target="_blank"}, Japan.  I have been under the supervision of [Professor Kensuke Harada](http://www.hlab.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/people/harada/){:target="_blank"} from October 2018. The website of our lab is [https://www.roboticmanipulation.org](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org){:target="_blank"}.  
Prior to Osaka University, I received my B.E. and M.E. from Harbin Institute of Technology, China.
