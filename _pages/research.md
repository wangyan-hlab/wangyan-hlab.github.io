My research focus is on robotic imitation of human assembly skills. Nowadays, the cell production has become an important ingredient of lean manufacturing, which involves many human assembly skills. To make industrial robots automatically complete such product assembly processes, we need to transfer human skills to robots in proper ways.

## Motion planning through human demonstration

We develop a motion planning approach using human demonstration, which can be applied to complete skillful motions in the robotic assembly process.

## Robotic learning of assembly skills

We present a combined learning framework for completing robotic assembly skills with proper force control learned independently of the force profile from human demonstration.
